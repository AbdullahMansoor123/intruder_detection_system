# Intruder Detection using Object Detection and Computer Vision

This project demonstrates a method for setting up an alert system for intruder detection using object detection and computer vision algorithms. The system can be modified to send alert directly to slack channel and whatapp using their respective API's.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Ultralytics YOLO library
- `exception.py`, `config.py`, and `utils.py` files provided with the code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/intruder-detection.git
    cd intruder-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the YOLO pre-trained weights file and place it in the appropriate directory (specified in `config.py`).

## Usage

1. Run the `intruder_detection.py` script:

    ```bash
    python intruder_detection.py
    ```

2. The script will capture video from the specified source (`sample_video`) and apply object detection to identify intruders in the frame.

3. A Region of Interest (ROI) is defined on the first frame, allowing you to specify areas where intruders should be detected.

4. Detected intruders are highlighted in the video feed, and an alert is triggered if an intruder enters the defined ROI.

5. Press 'q' to exit the program.

## Customization and Further Improvement

- Accuracy can be improved by adjusting parameters such as confidence threshold (`conf`) and class labels in the `config.py` file.
- Modify the `sample_video` variable to use a different video source.
- Also further code improve will also reduce the class miss detection chances.

## Future Improvement
- Modified the code to get get real time alert via raspberry pi based system for my home.
